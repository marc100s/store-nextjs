# Performance Optimizations Applied

## 🎯 **Image Optimizations**

### Fixed Issues:
1. **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) Images** - Added `priority` prop to images above the fold
2. **Aspect Ratio Warnings** - Added proper `style` attributes to maintain image proportions
3. **Animated GIF Optimization** - Marked animated GIFs as `unoptimized`

### Changes Made:

#### 1. **DealCountdown Component** (`/components/deal-countdown.tsx`)
- ✅ Added `priority` prop to promotional image
- ✅ Added `style={{ width: 'auto', height: 'auto' }}` to maintain aspect ratio

#### 2. **Loading Component** (`/app/loading.tsx`)  
- ✅ Added `unoptimized` prop for animated GIF
- ✅ Added proper styling to maintain aspect ratio

#### 3. **ProductCard Component** (`/components/shared/product/product-card.tsx`)
- ✅ Made `priority` prop conditional based on position
- ✅ Added responsive styling with `maxWidth: '100%'`
- ✅ Only first 4 products get `priority={true}` for better LCP

#### 4. **ProductList Component** (`/components/shared/product/product-list.tsx`)
- ✅ Updated to pass `priority={index < 4}` to product cards
- ✅ Ensures only above-the-fold products are prioritized

## 🔧 **Stripe Integration Optimizations**

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Elements Prop Change Warning** - Prevented unnecessary re-creation of Stripe promise
2. **Frame Not Initialized Error** - Optimized Elements options with useMemo

### Changes Made:

#### 1. **Stripe Payment Component** (`/app/(root)/order/[id]/stripe-payment.tsx`)
- ✅ **Moved Stripe promise creation outside component** to prevent recreation on re-renders
- ✅ **Added `useMemo` for Elements options** to prevent unnecessary re-initialization  
- ✅ **Imported `useMemo`** from React for optimization
- ✅ **Memoized appearance theme logic** to stabilize Elements props

```typescript
// Before: Created new promise on every render
const StripePayment = () => {
  const stripePromise = loadStripe(...); // ❌ Recreated each render
}

// After: Single promise instance
const stripePromise = loadStripe(...); // ✅ Created once, reused
const StripePayment = () => {
  const elementsOptions = useMemo(() => ({ ... })); // ✅ Memoized options
}
```

## 📊 **Performance Benefits**

### Image Optimizations:
- **Faster LCP** - Priority images load immediately  
- **Better CLS** - Proper aspect ratios prevent layout shifts
- **Reduced Bundle Size** - Conditional optimization for animated content

### Stripe Optimizations:
- **Eliminated re-initialization warnings**
- **Improved form stability** 
- **Better user experience** with consistent payment UI

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Test payment flow** with optimized Stripe integration
2. **Monitor Core Web Vitals** for LCP improvements  
3. **Consider lazy loading** for below-the-fold images
4. **Add `loading="eager"` fallback** for critical images

## 🔍 **Browser Console Status**

After these optimizations, you should see:
- ✅ No more "priority" prop warnings
- ✅ No more aspect ratio warnings  
- ✅ No more Stripe Elements prop change warnings
- ✅ Improved LCP scores
- ✅ Stable payment form initialization
